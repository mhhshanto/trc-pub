                <h2 className="sm:text-3xl text-2xl mt-5 font-semibold">TRC Sapphire Publisher welcomes new book proposals in all the major areas in which we publish.</h2>

                <p className="my-4">Whether you’re looking to turn your PhD thesis into a book, have an idea for an undergraduate textbook, a teaching resource, a handbook, a scholarly reference book, or are writing a book for a professional audience, we would love to hear from you. Please note that we don’t publish fiction books.</p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl mt-6 mb-4">What to consider before submitting your book proposal</h1>

                <p className="my-4">To give you an idea of what TRC Sapphire Publisher are looking for, here are a few questions to think about before getting in touch:</p>
                <li><span className="font-semibold">Does your book idea have a USP</span> – a unique selling point – an angle on the topic that is new, interesting, innovative and/or compelling?</li>

                <li><span className="font-semibold">Is there a clear demand for your book </span>from an academic or professional audience and what is it about your book idea that specific readers might want and/or need to read?</li>

                <li><span className="font-semibold">Is the scope of your book’s concept broad enough</span>to be of interest to readers on a global scale?</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold">What makes you the best person to write this book?</span> What is it about your experience, research and background which make you an expert?</li>

                <p className="my-4">
                    If you think your book idea can answer these questions successfully and you have some recent publishing experience (e.g. published articles or papers in journals or relevant academic or professional publications) please contact the most relevant Commissioning Editor in your field as early as possible. We also welcome proposals for cohesive edited collections with a strong theme and consistent quality through all chapters.
                </p>
                <p className="my-4">
                    Assuming your idea is suitable and aligns with our publishing framework, the Commissioning Editor will provide you with a specific book proposal form suitable for your subject area and book idea, which will help you capture all the key information.
                </p>

                <h1 className="text-2xl mt-6 mb-4">What a book proposal consists of</h1>

                <p className="my-4">
                    In essence, a book proposal is a document which provides an initial overview of a book or open access book project in advance of completing a book manuscript. For a detailed overview of what you will be expected to provide, please read our book proposal guidelines.
                </p>
                <p className="my-4">
                    Research-level books are often published as part of an established series, so having an awareness of existing books in such series can be useful when it comes to framing and developing your proposal.
                </p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl mt-6 mb-4">What happens after you submit your book proposal</h1>

                <p className="my-4">
                    Your proposal will initially be read by a Commissioning Editor to assess the suitability of your book for their publishing program (or 'list). Subject to your Editor's approval, your proposal will then undergo an external peer review process in which experts are engaged to provide feedback on the quality and scope of your work, before your work is submitted to the Publishing Committee (or Editorial Board) for final approval. If your book proposal is approved, you will then be offered a publishing contract.
                </p>
